**Rotational Model for Young Stellar Objects**

This Python code simulates the rotational evolution of young stellar  objects, considering the influence of accretion, magnetic braking, and  the presence of a protoplanetary disk. The model is based on the Baraffe stellar evolution data and includes numerical solutions for the system  of differential equations governing the star's rotation rate over time.

**Key Features:**

- Utilizes Baraffe stellar evolution data for initial conditions.
- Numerically integrates differential equations to model accretion, magnetic braking, and disk effects.
- Adaptive step size adjustment during integration for accuracy and efficiency.
- Provides outputs including time evolution of rotational velocity, torque components, radii, mass, and period.

**Usage:**

1. Specify the stellar parameters, including mass, rotation period, accretion rate, disk temperature, and magnetic field strength.
2. Run the `Rotational_model` function to obtain time-dependent rotational evolution data.
3. Analyze and visualize the results using the returned arrays.

**Dependencies:**

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

**Example Usage:**

~~~python
```
from rotational_model import Rotational_model
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set stellar parameters

Mass = 1.0  # Solar masses
Prot = 8.0  # Rotation period in days
Macc = 1e-7  # Accretion rate in solar masses per year
Tdisk = 1e6  # Disk temperature in years
Bfield = 2500  # Magnetic field strength in Gauss
betta = 0.01
gamma = 1.0
APSW = 0.1

# Run the rotational model

time, vrot, period = Rotational_model(Mass, Prot, Macc, Tdisk, Bfield, betta, gamma, APSW)

# Plot the results

plt.plot(time, vrot, label='Rotational Velocity')
plt.xlabel('Time (years)')
plt.ylabel('Rotational Velocity (km/s)')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
